Welcome to pyCraft's documentation!
===================================

``pyCraft`` is a python project to handle networking
between a Minecraft server as a client. 

The authentication package contains utilities to manage communicating 
with Mojang's authentication servers in order to log in with a minecraft
account, edit profiles etc

The Connection class under the networking package handles
connecting to a server, sending packets, listening for packets etc

The example implementation show a couple different approaches to how
you can get started with the library. One from command line and the
other being more programmatically inclined.
