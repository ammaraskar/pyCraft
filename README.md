Minecraft Python Client!

When running start.py, make sure you duck.

#Requirements
- wxPython (In the requirements.txt for all you pip fans, however you can avoid this.)

Basically, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, which should pull everything in. You need a compiler.

Eventually we'll put some run instructions here.

Have fun!
