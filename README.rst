Minecraft Python Client Library!

This projects aims to be a modern, Python3-compatible, well-documented library for
communication with a MineCraft server.

Detailed information for developers can be found here:
`<http://pycraft.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.

``start.py`` is a basic example of a headless client using the library
Use ``start.py --help`` for the options.

Python version
--------------
We aim to be compatible with the following python versions:

* Python 2.7
* Python 3.3
* Python 3.4
* Python 3.5
* Python 3.6
* PyPy

Requirements
------------
- `cryptography <https://github.com/pyca/cryptography#cryptography>`_ 
- `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/>`_
- `future <http://python-future.org/>`_

The requirements are also stored in ``requirements.txt``

See the installation instructions for the cryptography library here: `<https://cryptography.io/en/latest/installation/>`_
but essentially ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` should cover everything.
