"""Types for enumerations of values occurring in packets, including operations
   for working with these values.

   The values in an enum are given as class attributes with UPPERCASE names.

   These classes are usually not supposed to be instantiated, but sometimes an
   instantiatable class may subclass Enum to provide class enum attributes in
